```
mvn test
```

To run specific tests, use the following command:
```
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @yourTag"

## Reporting
Allure Reporting is used to generate test reports. To generate and view the report:

```
mvn clean test
```

Generate the Allure report:
```
allure generate target/allure-results --clean -o target/allure-report
```

## Code Examples
### Sample Test Case
#### Java

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

class LoginTest {
@Test
void testLogin() {
LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
HomePage homePage = loginPage.login("your-username", "your-password");
